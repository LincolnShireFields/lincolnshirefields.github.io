<p>The Lincolnshire Fields Homeowners Association (LFHA) was incorporated on January 26, 1967 as a 501(c)4 Social Welfare Organization to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the residents within the subdivision.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its membership is comprised of the owners of the some 451 residences in the Lincolnshire Fields Subdivision located in Champaign County, Illinois.</p>

<p>Incorporators were Robert Shapland, John C. (Jack) O'Byrne, and Michael O'Byrne.&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the first Board of Directors were Robert Shapland, Jack O'Byrne, and Louis Brandt.&nbsp;&nbsp;When by-laws were adopted on May 31, 1967, the board was increased to six members.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the by-laws were revised for the first time on April 30, 2005, the all-voluteer board was increased to a number not less than seven with each member to serve a term of three years.</p>

<p>As of April 1, 2006, the Lincolnshire Fields Homeowners Association consisted of 12 subdivisions including 403 single-family homes, 42 condominiums, and 2 common areas; all are more fully described in Exhibits I and II of the by-laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these properties are within an area of approximately one square mile located west of the City of Champaign and bounded roughly by Windsor Road on the south, Kirby Avenue on the north, Ducan Road on the east, and Staley Road on the west.</p>
<p>A roster of residents required by covenant to become members of LFHA when they have purchased property within the defined boundaries of Lincolnshire Fields and have agreed to be subject to the levy of assessments not to exceed twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per year is maintained by the Board Secretary.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association is notified of home or condominium purchases and sales by attorneys, bankers, or realtors who request assessment status letters prior to closing.</p>

<p>Periodically, a listing of home owners and addresses is obtained from the Champaign County Recorder's Office in order to revise the existing LFHA list.</p>

<p>The LFHA provides electric pole lighting through the local power company at ten of the subdivision entrances; the most recent one was placed at Eagle Ridge Road and Windsor Road on August 7, 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp;Free yard waste pickups have been provided twice each year since 1999.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Lincolnshire Fields Homeowners Association Newsletter is published twice a year via this Internet site; each Newsletter is mailed to those members who explicitly request that it be mailed.</p>

<p>Assessments have been levied by the board every two or three years only as required to meet operating expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpaid assessments are followed up by collection letters or phone calls until all are paid.<br><br>When covenant violations are referred to the LFHA Board, letters are written to violators and follow-ups made until remedial action is acheived.&nbsp;&nbsp;Insurance policies in force include Directors and Officers coverage (for errors and omissions) and a comprehensive general liability policy covering the two common areas.</p>

<p>Originally, there was an Architectural Control Committee for each of the twelve subdivisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;As of May 23, 2001, the twelve Architectural Control Committees were merged into a single committee consisting of three members with responsibility for review and approval of submitted proposals for additions or modifications of property to include sheds, pools, fences, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;This function of the Architectural Control Committee maintains the integrity of the neighborhood and the value of the several properties.</p>
