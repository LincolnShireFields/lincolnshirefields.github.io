On-going property concern:  The president of the board has tried numerous times in various ways to get a homeowner to clean up his property as well as the adjacent lot, which he uses for storage and overflow.  Bob has had little to no success in this regard.   <br /><br /><br /><br />There will be two Fall Yard Waste pick-ups.  The first pick-up is Monday October 26, 2009, and Tuesday, October 27, 2009.  The second pick-up is Monday, November 23, 2009, and Tuesday, November 24, 2009.    This is in response to homeowners’ requests which came up at the annual meeting.<br /><br />Treasurer’s Report: 1.) Ann turned over a bill sent by Vern Magnuson for his work on the LFHA website which amounted to about $562.00. Ann moved the bill be paid with the stipulation to watch the fees.  Bob seconded.  2.) Ann presented an updated budget to reflect the additional yard waste pick-up.  She will amend the budget to show the web site fees, also.   3.)  Ann said a letter of  Official Notice needs to be sent to homeowners about the collection of the $25 LFHA assessment.   She had a draft for members to read.  It was decided that the Fall Newsletter should go out by September 15, 2009 with notification that a letter would be coming about the assessment.  Ann will send it out by October 1, 2009, with the receipt of payment deadline being November 15, 2009.  4.) Ameren /Glenshire light situation:  There still is confusion about LFHA and the city both paying for the Glenshire light.  Ann will bill Glenshire and see if we can get this straightened out.  <br /><br />Old Business:  The Commons.  Scott Anderson presented a draft of the resolution concerning the rules for use and maintenance of the Southeast Commons area.  The resolution was amended to refer to the Northeast Commons, also.  The resolution passed unanimously.  It will go into the By-laws as an addendum.  All homeowners in both commons areas will receive letters concerning this resolution.  The Lincolnshire Fields brick sign at Kirby and Cobblefield. Many homeowners would like to see beautification of the area in front of the sign.  A Master Gardener has said that she would like to work on plantings for that area, and she thought she could get other Master Gardeners who live nearby to help.  Bob and Jerry will talk to the homeowner who owns the property that the sign is on to see if some agreement can be reached.  Jeanne Martin will talk to the Master Gardener and see if a committee could be formed to work on this project.<br /><br />The SWC-MTD.  Jerry was in contact with Ted Vaughn about the judge’s latest ruling, which was sort of a split decision for CU-MTD and SWC-MTD.  The final ruling is yet to come.  Jerry will attend a meeting of the SWC-MTD board on August 13, 2009. <br /><br />New Business:  LFHA picnic/get together.   We hope that Jennace will serve as the board representative on a committee to determine the following:  interest; location; budget; and date of the event. Newsletter:  The newsletter that goes out September 15, 2009 will have items referring to the two yard waste pick-ups in the fall; the county waste disposal area that homeowners can take burnable yard waste items to, free of charge, on their own; reminder that there will be an assessment of $25 for 2010 and that a letter will be coming with information about that; asking about interest in the picnic/get together and instructing people who want to be on the organizing committee to contact Jennace Linton.  <br /><br />Next Board Meeting:  The next board meeting will be on Tuesday, November 10th, 2009, at Bob Todd’s home, 3326 Stoneybrook Drive, Champaign, at 7:00 p.m.<br /><br />Adjournment:  The meeting was adjourned at 8:05 a.m.  <br /><br />Respectfully submitted,Kathy Barton for Jennace Linton<br /><br /></font></span>
