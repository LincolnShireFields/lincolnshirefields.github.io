<span id="lblMinutes" style="display:inline-block;"><font color="Black" face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">                 Minutes of the LFHA Board Meeting Monday, May 17, 2011<br /><br />Call to order:  President Scott Anderson called the meeting to order at 8:15 p.m. at Lincolnshire Fields country club.<br /><br />Members Present: Scott Anderson, Ann Webbink, John Ison, Jennace Linton, Jeff Hays, Max Mitchell.Members Absent: Paul Kane<br /><br />Approval of Minutes:  The minutes of the Feb, 2011 meeting were approved. <br /><br />Treasurer’s Report:  Ann passed out copies of her report. She indicated that it is time once again to file with the state. Ann pointed out that we have had more expenses than in previous years with improvements recently made, however, financially we are still in good shape.  The CD matures on 6/11/11 and the interest will be put into the checking account. She asked for approval to pay for copies of documents made and payment of bills that have been submitted. Motion approved.  Treasurer’s report was approved. <br /><br />President’s Report: The home at 3202 Meadow Brook is now vacant. The owner is in the nursing home. It needs to be mowed. John will see to it that it gets mowed and that someone is contracted to do it on a regular basis until it is either taken over by the bank or other arrangements have been made. <br /><br />The house at 3101 Stoneybrook still has vehicles parked on the street. Scott will write a letter to them. If that does not help, Max will talk to them since he is a friend with the family. <br /><br />Election of officers: All board members agreed to continue with their current offices and duties. <br /><br />Old Business: The entrance sign looks good. It is the board’s desire to keep up with the maintenance so we do not have a major undertaking with it in the near future. John will help oversee that project as well as replacing some plants that died. It was suggested that we look at the plants and contact Brown Woods for replacements since they are a year guarantee. John will look into this as well.  At the annual meeting, a request was put out for volunteers to water and weed. Adam Becker agreed to assist. (phone numbers: 561-758-4705 and 217-403-1459) The solar lighting that Scott put in is working however additional lighting that would last for 8 hours would be preferred. Scott will look into for powerful solar lighting options. <br /><br />Rick Hallbeck questioned if “The Greens” could do a contribution rather than pay the new increased amount in the dues. They have been paying $25 a year per homeowner to obtain LFHA privileges, even though they are in the city. A motion was made to accept their dues voluntarily at $25 since they are in the city but this will allow them member privileges. Motion passed. <br /><br />At the annual meeting, consensus from members in attendance indicated that the board should take the necessary steps to increase dues. We need to consult with an attorney to learn exactly what steps are needed in accordance with the law to change the covenants. Scott suggested we talk to Paul Cole. Max said another possibility is Michael Burn. A motion was made to seek further consultation on requirements to change covenants and increase dues. Motion passed. <br /><br />New Business: None<br /><br />Adjournment:  Next board meeting will be August 11th at 7:30 at the Original Pancake House. Max will call the restaurant to reserve the back room. The meeting was adjourned at 8:45 p.m.<br /><br />Respectfully submitted,Jennace Linton</font></span>
