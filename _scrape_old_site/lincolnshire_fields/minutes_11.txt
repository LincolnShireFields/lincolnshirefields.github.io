<span id="lblMinutes" style="display:inline-block;"><font color="Black" face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">Minutes of the LFHA Board Meeting, November 3, 2008Location: Ann Webbink&#39;s home<br /><br />Members Present: Bob Todd, Robert Frederick, Ann Webbink, Jeanne Martin, Kathy Barton, Jennace Linton<br /><br />Members absent: Jerry Benson<br /><br />Call to order: The call to order was given at 7:05 P.M. <br /><br />Approval of Minutes: The August 4, 2008 minutes were approved. <br /><br />President&#39;s Report: Bob reported that Dave McGrath, Road Commissioner has retired. He cooperated well with the board and homeowners. It&#39;s our hope that Keith Padgett, the new commissioner, will continue in the same vein. Keith will retain the same contact numbers. <br /><br />The yard waste pick up is scheduled for Nov. 24th. There will be an increase in the cost per stop. <br /><br />Bob addressed questions and concerns brought to him by homeowners:      *Fire pit is taken care of in the SE Commons. A letter sent by a homeowner thanking the board for taking action in a profession and diplomatic way.       * Bob called people making the complaints about flower bed conditions, grass, weeds, etc where homes are for sale and/or vacant and suggested they should call the Real Estate company handling the property.       *A letter has been sent to a homeowner on Meadow Brook Ct since several people have complained about its deteriorating condition. The home is literally falling down with broken gutters, and fencing and roofing repairs are needed. It seems the personal situation with the homeowner is not good with a divorce, depression and financial problems. The neighbors have been helping by mowing the lawn. The county and the board can&#39;t do anything.       *A letter was sent to Bob about items left outside a home that is having some construction done on it. Not only was the letter nasty but since it was unsigned as well, the board&#39;s view is to ignore the complaint.       *People would like to see the Lincolnshire field sign at Cobblefield and Kirby maintained. This presents a problem because the land is private where the sign is located and the landowners don&#39;t want to be responsible for plantings around the sign. It was suggested that we look into more in 2009 and perhaps even consider having the sign removed.  <br /><br />Treasurer&#39;s Report: Ann handed out the current financial report. She stated that the interest rate is low on the CD. Ann noted that we received payment from Glenshire Association. It was approved that Ann may purchase stamps. <br /><br />Ann questioned LFHA paying power for several of the lights that might not be our responsibility such as at Cobblefield /Kirby, NE corner of Stoneybrook/Duncan, and Windsor/Eagle Ridge. When Ameren was called, these were indicated as city property. Bob will talk to Steve Carter, city manager and see what can be resolved. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Old Business On the matter of the Southeast Commons, discussions continued about how the proposals set forth would affect neighbor relations caused by forcing removal, properties with pools needing fences for insurance and liability, legal battles that could ensue following Board action to force an end to encroachments, and the added expense to the LFHA should SE Commons homeowners respond to Board action by terminating maintenance activities, including lawn mowing. The board resolved that it does not favor the removal of difficult-to-move encroachments such as fences &amp; pools and preferred to grandfather in all existing encroachments rather than picking and choosing some encroachments such as certain fences that are more than 25 years old. Bob Fredericks was given the task of putting together a plan that would be voted on at the next meeting to grandfather in existing encroachments with a statement that no new structures or plantings take place without board approval. A hold harmless document will be requested from affected homeowners that would free LFHA from liability exposure in those areas. It was also decided that a committee be formed regarding limiting the vehicular traffic onto the SE commons.<br /><br />A letter was sent to Lincolnshire Condominium Association but there was no response so it is assumed that they do not wish to be a part of LFHA. <br /><br />Bentbrook Association was sent a letter about the sprinkler repairs. They signed off on it, which now concludes our business with that situation.<br /><br />In previous years, yard waste was collected on the Monday following Thanksgiving. Since Thanksgiving was later this year, the fall date was set for November 24th , which is a week prior to Thanksgiving.  Before selecting a date for next year, checking how much waste was picked up might determine if we again select the Monday after Thanksgiving or an earlier date.  <br /><br />The Web site covenants were not discussed as Jerry knows more about which ones are missing on the site and he was absent.    <br /><br />New Business: LFHA wishes to tend to some of the trees on the southeast commons that need trimming or removal.  It was suggested that Bob Frederick and Jennace Linton walk the SE commons in the spring to consider which trees should be trimmed and bring those recommendations to the May meeting.  <br /><br />LFHA board membership needs to be considered at the next meeting so a slate of members and officers can be submitted at the annual meeting. Bob Frederick will be leaving. Ann Webbink is willing to continue as Treasurer. It is suggested that we look at our board make-up to consider representation on both sides of the LFHA community. <br /><br />Miscellaneous BusinessSeveral years ago a realtor printed a handbook of neighbors. Several members thought it would be a nice idea to resurrect that again. Since the homes change ownership frequently, the feasibility of creating one was discussed.  It was decided that this might be something to discuss at the annual meeting and also wondered if a realtor might be approached to again consider putting one together. <br /><br />Next Board Meeting: February 19, 7:00 P.M. at Kathy Barton&#39;s, 1903 Byrnebruk. ChampaignAdjournment: 8:15 P.M. </font></span>
