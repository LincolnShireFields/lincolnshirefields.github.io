He asked about putting them all into one. Members agreed that it should just remain as is for now. Perhaps, could become a long range goal.<br /><br />On concerns and calls: Where trash had been on the curb for a long time, it has now been removed. On Lake Point were a spot light was shining into a yard across the lake, it too has been rectified. On Staley and Kirby, there is a fence up and no mowing on the other side of it. Scott talked to them. On Valleybrook, a homeowner is parking 2 boats and a van in his driveway. Scott talked to him.  Currently the owner has moved one of the boats into the garage. It was also noted that on Clubhouse Dr, there are many construction vehicles parked on the street, however Scott can’t do much to rectify that situation. <br /><br />Treasurer’s Report:  Ann passed out copies of her report. She discussed some specifics. The Woods bill comes each month and totals $800 a year. There are two insurance policies; general and Board of Directors. Anne will cut two checks; one to Jennace for postage and one for herself for copies made. She will be sending out letters requesting dues. Ann called Busey for a form letter to return to them when people are refinancing their homes, which seems to be quite a few lately. 3 liens will be filed. Treasurer’s  report was approved. <br /><br />Old Business: At 2008 Bentbrook, owners are raising pit bulls in the garage. Thus they have 5-6 cars out on the street everyday and screens are off the garage. It was requested that Scott give them a call. <br /><br />Tyler Moss home on Farhills is being sold and there has been a complaint registered that there is no street lamp. A discussion ensued about whether we can we require a street lamp be installed before selling takes place. Scott will inform the owner that a street lamp should be installed as per the covenant. <br /><br />New Business: Scott would like to host a dinner at his home to have a brain storming session concerning topics about “What can we do the make Lincolnshire Fields better.” Possible areas might be: improving the entrance sign, looking into areas that don’t have sidewalks, trimming up/removing older and damaged trees on the commons, etc. The meeting was then scheduled for Sept 21st at 6:30. Scott will provide the meat and beverages and everyone will bring a side dish. <br /><br />Misc. Business: Jennace will get 3 estimates on tree removal and trimming for trees on south commons. Jeanne will get some estimates and suggestions for new lettering on the entrance sign. <br /><br />The fall pick ups will be October 25th and November 22nd. <br /><br />Next Board Meeting:  The next board meeting will be on Monday, November 1, 2010, at 7:00 P.M. at Jeanne Martin’s home. <br /><br />Adjournment:  The meeting was adjourned at 8:00 a.m.<br /><br />Respectfully submitted,Jennace Linton<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></font></span>
