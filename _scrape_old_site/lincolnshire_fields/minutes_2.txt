Frederick, KassieNudo, Sue Schinimel, Greg Thorn, Ann Webbink, Dominic Skaperdas<br /><br />Members Absent: None<br /><br />Call-to Order: The meeting was called to order at 7:00 PM.<br /><br />Approval of the Minutes: The minutes of the Board meeting of August7, 2006 were reviewed and approved.<br /><br />Treasurer&#39;s Report: 	Ann reported on the collection of the recently passed annual assessment of $25.00, which was due October 31,2006. She stated that over 80 percent of LFHA homeowners have paid this year&#39;s assessment. She reviewed the LFHA fiscal balance report beginning 8/5/06 and ending 1/6/06. The report was accepted and a copy is appended to these minutes.<br /><br />	A discussion followed on how to collect current assessments from delinquents. A history of the laborious past efforts in collecting from delinquents led to a proposal for a stricter procedure which would ultimately involve placing a lien on the property of resolute delinquents. Due account would be taken for those who have a legitimate excuse. Accordingly, a motion was made and passed wherein a first-class letter will be sent stating that there will be a $10.00 late payment fee if assessments have not been paid by December 31, 2006. Furthermore, if delinquents have not responded by then, a registered letter will be sent stating that a lien will be placed on their properties and that removing such liens would involve paying the due assessment, late payment fee and LFHA&#39;s cost of the lien.<br /><br />	Future Spring Newsletters will remind homeowners of the yearly assessment.<br /><br />President&#39;s Report: 	Jerry reported on the Village of Savoy Fire Department&#39;s discontinuance of fire protection on April I, 2007 for regions contiguous to LFHA. It so happened that one LFHA homeowner is involved. The Bondville Fire Department will be contacted to ensure that this property is included in LFHA/Bondville fire protection plan. The Board Book was updated to correct Sue&#39;s telephone number to 356-7543. Jerry stated that he was unable to commit time to the LFHA Commons.<br /><br />	Committee and that ex-LFHA Secretary Steve Johnson has volunteered to be on this committee. Robert Frederick, as chairman, has the responsibility to form the Commons Committee in any way he sees fit.<br /><br />Old Business: 	Ann reported that LFHA has received tax exempt status from the US Government and that application for the same has been made to the State of Illinois. Jerry reported on the stalling of the CSW MTD Board appointments by the Champaign County Board Chairperson. Local elections taking place today may resolve this stalling.<br /><br />New Business: 	One of the two lights illuminating the LFHA sign at the comer of Staley and Bentbrook has needed replacement. The bulb is a special high-cost type. Even though Ameren IP provides and charges LFHA for the power to. this lighting system they do not service it. In order to simplify and ease demands on LFHA Board members, all of whom are volunteers, a motion was made and approved to abandon this lighting system and for Dominic to contact Ameren IP for the installation of a light pole at this comer, similar to those at our other eight entrances and maintained by them.<br /><br />	Jerry described metal reflector signs that might replace the two wooden entrance signs at Staley/Brentwood and Duncan/Stoneybrook. Sue will visit the sign maker and bring samples at our next meeting.Greg presented a report of his Sign Committee, a copy of which is appended to these minutes. The report concludes&quot; We recommend adding no new signs other than exploring the addition of metal Lincolnshire Field signs at all entrances on township street sign poles. Additional major consideration should be given to preserving the attractive signage at Kirby and Cobblefield.&quot; Greg will draft a letter signed by him to the condo association at Duncan/Stoneybrook describing our plans.<br /><br />	The Board discussed next year&#39;s Board makeup. Greg, as the current Vice President, by custom, is slated to be President. However, due to time constraints, he will be unable to take this position. Dominic&#39;s term as Secretary, expires in May 2007and will retire from this position. Jerry&#39;s term also expires May 2007 and Kassie will be resigning from the Board this spring. Board members were advised to start recruitment for the posts of President and Secretary and proposing new Board members.Kassie brought up a problem with a satellite dish set away from the house in the middle of a neighbor&#39;s property. It was suggested that she consult with the architectural committee to see if they could resolve the problem.The Board approved the payment of bills pertaining to LFHA businesss by Treasurer Ann Webbink.<br /><br />Next Board Meeting: The next Board meeting was set for Monday, February 12, 2007, 7:00 PM at the home of Ann Webb ink, 3909 Far Hills.<br /><br />Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 8:47 PM.<br /><br />Respectfully submitted,<br /><br />Dominic Skanperdas - Secretary<br /><br /><br /><br />LINCOLNSHIRE FIELDS HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION TREASURER&#39;S REPORT FOR BOARD MEETING 11-7-06 8-6-06 THROUGH 11-6-06<br /><br />Beginning Balance on 8-5-06------$5735.30<br /><br />Income: Assessments as of 11-6-06---------8900.00 Bank Interest-----------------------17.85 Total Income-----------$8917.85 <br /><br />Expenses: Ameren IP-----------------------------------411.48Printing and Mailing (Upc1ose Printing)-----250.96Postage and Ledger books---------------------19.87Other (tree removal)------------------------800.00Total Expense----------$1482.31<br /><br />Ending Balance on 11-6-06-------$13170.84<br /><br />Checking balance----------------------$9068.057 Month CD (5.15% APY) matures 3/07---$4102.79<br /><br />Total:-------$13170.84<br /><br /></font></span>
