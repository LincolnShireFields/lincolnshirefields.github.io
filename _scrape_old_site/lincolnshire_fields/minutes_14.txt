She believes that since the number of scheduled Fall yard pick ups was increased at the annual meeting, money budgeted in the yard waste category should be increased to reflect 2 fall pick ups. Ann  suggested an amount needed to cover this new expenditure. This amended budget was then voted on and approved.  Ann will change the figures and distribute the corrected budget at the next meeting. <br /><br />Old BusinessMr. Hays will scan in the covenants.<br /><br />Ann brought up the street light transfer with the 3 lights belonging to the city at Kirby/Coblefield; Duncan/Stoneybrook; and Windsor/Fields South.
