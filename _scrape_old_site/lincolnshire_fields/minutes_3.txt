<span id="lblMinutes" style="display:inline-block;"><font color="Black" face="Arial,Tahoma" size="2">Minutes of the LFHA Board Meeting, February 12, 2007 <br /><br />Location: Home of Ann Webbink, 3909 Far Hills, Champaign <br /><br />Members Present: Jerry Benson, Robert Frederick, Sue Schimmel, Greg Thom, Ann Webbink, Dominic Skaperdas. <br /><br />Members Absent: Kassie Nudo.<br /><br />Call to Order: The meeting was called to order at 7:05 PM<br /><br />Approval of the Minutes: The minutes of the Board meeting of November 7, 2006 were reviewed and approved.<br /><br />Treasurer&#39;s Report: 	Ann reported that all but one assessments have been collected. The exception is LFHA member Jack Hayes, who has refused to pay in spite of several contacts by our Treasurer. President Jerry will personally call on him for payment, and if this fails, a motion was made and passed to file a lien against his residence for payment and expenses. Another motion was made and passed to send all future first assessment letters by first class mail<br /><br />	Ann presented LFHA&#39;s expenditures for the calendar year 2006 and the Treasurer&#39;s report for the period l l/6/06 to 2/12/07. Both reports were accepted by the Board and are appended to these minutes.<br /><br />	The Board approved the sum of $19.94 to Ann Webbink for her incurred expenses.<br /><br />President&#39;s Report: 	A request to join LFHA was presented to Jerry by Terry Schmitt, who represents eight units at 7 Fields East. Jerry will contact Dan Hallbeck to determine if Fields East was originally part of LFHA. If not he will consult the legality of this matter with attorney Brett Kepley<br /><br />	Jerry reported that the CS MTD now has a new Board. The Board will request the County Clerk to place a referendum asking for an assessment of 0.025% of all residences in its jurisdiction for legal fees and operating expenses connected with establishing the CS MTD.<br /><br />	The LFHA entrance sign at the corner of Staley and Bentbrook has fallen off its supporting structure. Since a light pole has been ordered for this corner the residents of the condominiums on whose property the present sign exists have requested that the remaining wood structure be removed. Sue will contact handyman Lowell Seaton<br /><br />Old Business: 	Sue displayed several pictures of possible entrance signs in the price range of $900 to $ 1700 by American Dowell. The Board decided that this type of entrance sign would be too difficult to employ because of the legal and maintenance problems involved in installing them on private properties.<br /><br />	Ann reported that LFHA&#39;s request for Illinois State tax exemption was rejected. LFHA does have Federal income tax exemption. After debating the consequences of LFHA never having paid State income taxes it was decided that we should now start paying them. Since the tax amount would be very small (under $250) any possible back taxes and penalties could be easily handled. Robert will determine the proper income tax form to be filed.<br /><br />	Dominic reported on the status of the pole light at the corner of Staley and Bentbrook which was ordered on 12/19/06. Inquiries at Ameren&#39;s Engineering and Construction site yielded a starting date of March 1, 2007 and a contract number 5639883850. Ron Schneider, the engineer assigned to our project, rarely returns calls and never submitted a cost estimate, which he promised on December 19, 2006. Dominic will continue to press for project completion.<br /><br />	Access to the two commons was discussed. Robert pointed out that, even though there is no public access to the NVV commons, LFHA can obtain access through any property for maintenance purposes. The Commons Committee will soon meet to work on the difficult problem of removing encroachments on the SE commons.<br /><br />	Board members were again advised to continue recruiting for new nominees for the Board. Dominic&#39;s term expires in May, 2007 and Kassie will be resigning from the Board on that date.<br /><br />New Business: 	Sue was instructed to send LFHA&#39;s newsletter by March 15. The letter will include the following: The annual Spring Yard Waste Pickup to take place on May 7 and 8: a notice for those residents selling homes to ask their realtors to notify LFHA. A reminder of the annual September assessment, which will be delinquent after October 31, 2007, after which there will be a $10.00 late fee: and, finally, a letter of thanks for all who have paid their assessments without time consuming reminders by the Treasurer.<br /><br />	For this year only the Board voted to move the Annual Meeting date from the second Tuesday of May to the third, May 15, 2007 in order to have a majority of the Board members present. Greg Thom will reserve a meeting room at the Lincolnshire Fields Country Club for the Annual Meeting.<br /><br />Next Board Meeting: The next Board meeting was set for Apnl 30, 2007, 7:00 PM at the home of Greg Thom, 3005 Stoneybrook.<br /><br />Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 8:40 PM.<br /><br />Respectfully, submitted,Dominic Skaperdas, Secretary </font></span>
