is a service provided by LFHA in conjunction with the Champaign

                           A Message from the Board of Directors

Dues Structure. 
    This fall and winter we circulated proxies with two issues to be
voted upon by the members; to increase dues to $50 for the next year
and to allow the Board to set reasonable dues in the future without
requiring an 80% affirmative vote. Ihe vote setting dues this year
at $50.00 per household passed, the one removing the upper limit
failed. As you can see from the report of expenditures included in
this newsletter, we need dues to be in excess of the traditional
$25.00 to be able to continue to do the things that the membership
has asked the Board to coordinate or to do new tasks suggested by
the members from time to time.

Your Board worked tirelessly, literally going door-to-door, to
inform the members of the need for these two issues to be addressed.
To those of you who volunteered to help, we express our gratitude.
However, it is simply impractical to expend this type of effort each
year to address the dues level which will remain at $25 annually
unless a change is authorized.

At this year's Annual Meeting we will provide members an opportunity
to express their thoughts on both our dues and additional
expenditures. From that input we will circulate new proxy's intended
to address this issue for the long term. As the By-Laws now stand,
any changes will require the positive vote of 80% of the members to
pass.

Yard Waste Pick up. 
    Spring Yard Waste Pick-up Day is May 7th. Fall pick-up dates are
October 22nd and November 19th. Mark your calendars and take
advantage of this service provided by our Township Road
Commissioner, Keith Padget and paid for by your homeowners
association dues.

Lincolnshire Fields Fire Protection District. 
    As you may recall, your Board supported the recent referendum
offered by the LFFPD which raised taxes to insure that they would
continue to contract with a volunteer fire department. We were
pleased that it passed and that the LFFPD can continue their good
work.

Webmaster. 
    Our most recent web site manager has moved from our subdivision
so we are seeking a volunteer or nominations at the annual meeting
for this important post. We would appreciate the membership's
thoughts on how best to use our website.

Annual Meeting. 
    Our Annual Membership Meeting will be held Tuesday, May 8, 2012
at the Lincolnshire Fields Country Club. There will be cocktails
(Cash Bar) and complimentary hors-de-oeuvre's beginning at 6:30 PM
with the meeting beginning promptly at 7:00 PM. We encourage all of
you to attend so your concerns can be voiced and it is a great
opportunity to socialize with your neighbors !

911 Beacon Lamps. 
    The Board still has a small supply of 911 Beacon lamps. These
lamps are designed to be used in the typical house, porch and yard
light fixtures. It operates like a regular 60 watt incandescent lamp
in normal use. But, if you have an emergency at your home, you can
turn the lamp off and on three times and the lamp will begin
flashing--making it easier for police, fire, and ambulance
responders to quickly identify the residence where help is needed.

The lamps are guaranteed to last for 2000 hours of normal use. They
are available at our cost to homeowners at $12.00 each. If you are
interested in buying some, please send in the order form made a part
of the mailed copy of the newsletter with your payment, or contact
Treasurer Ann Webbink at 3909 Farhills Drive, Champaign, IL 61822 or
at (217) 840-9190.

NEIGHBORHOOD GARAGE SALE
    Our Board has selected June 9, 2012 as the date for a
subdivision wide yard/garage sale.

Please fill out the form on your mailed copy of the newsletter and
mail to Jeff Hays or email him (hays2@comcast.net -- garage sale in
the subject line please) to advise us if you would like to
particpate or volunteer to help.

We will advertise the event and if enough volunteers step forward,
we will hand out subdivision maps with participating houses
identified to garage salers at the entrances to the subdivision. At
the annual meeting, we will also solicit suggestions on how to make
this a successful event.

So, join in the fun and get rid of some of the extra stuff you have
around your house and yard.
