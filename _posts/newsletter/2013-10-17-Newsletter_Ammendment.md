Dear Homeowner:

The fall newsletter contained two errors which this message will correct:

1. The dates for the fall yard waste pick-up will be Monday, October 21
and Monday, November 18 rather than 10/22 and 11/19 as listed in the
newsletter.

2. In my report I referred to a dangerous situation for pedestrians at
the "Cobblefield/Byrnebruk curve. I should have said “Clubhouse Dr. to
Byrnebruk”.

Sorry for any confusion ether error may have caused.

John
