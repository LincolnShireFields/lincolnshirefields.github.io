Each of the several Covenants documents provides for the existence
of, purpose for, and membership of the Architectural Control
Committee.  Please consult your specific Covenants for details as
that document takes precedence over any information provided on this
page.  (NOTE:  The membership of the Architectural Control Committee
contained in each Covenants document is outdated.  The list above is
current.)

If you are planning modifications to your home and/or lot that will
change the external appearance of your property, it is advisable to
speak with    any member of the Committee prior to finalizing your
plans and, certainly, before you begin your modification.  The
member, whom you contact, will help you decide if your plans will
require explicit approval by the Architecture Control Committee.

You may call any one of the Committee members using the phone
numbers above.  Alternatively, you may email the Committee by
selecting "Email LFHA" from the main menu and then selecting
"Architectural Control Committee" from among the Subject Categories.
